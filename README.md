- Backend implementation without frontend

### Registration Form:
- User registration functionality
- Handlebars templating for user interface

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Handlebars (hbs)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (if applicable)
4. Run the application: `node app.js`

## Usage
